        SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a method to explain individual predictions 
        from machine learning models. It's based on game theory and tells you how much 
        each feature contributed to the final decision.
        """,
        
        "how_shap_works": """
        Imagine your loan application is being reviewed by a committee. Each committee member 
        (representing a feature like age, income, credit score) votes on whether to approve 
        your loan. SHAP calculates how much each member's vote influenced the final decision.
        
        The process:
        1. Start with a baseline (average prediction for everyone)
        2. Add each feature one by one
        3. Measure how much the prediction changes
        4. Average across all possible orders of adding features
        5. This gives a fair "credit" to each feature
        """,
        
        "positive_shap": """
        A positive SHAP value means this feature is pushing the prediction toward APPROVAL.
        
        Example: If your CreditScore has a SHAP value of +0.15, it means your credit score 
        is increasing your approval probability by 15 percentage points compared to the average.
        """,
        
        "negative_shap": """
        A negative SHAP value means this feature is pushing the prediction toward REJECTION.
        
        Example: If your DTIRatio (debt-to-income) has a SHAP value of -0.12, it means your 
        debt level is decreasing your approval probability by 12 percentage points.
        """,
        
        "magnitude": """
        The size (absolute value) of the SHAP value tells you HOW IMPORTANT that feature is.
        
        - Small values (< 0.05): Minor influence
        - Medium values (0.05-0.15): Moderate influence  
        - Large values (> 0.15): Major influence
        """,
        
        "fairness": """
        SHAP ensures fairness through mathematical properties:
        
        1. **Additivity**: All SHAP values sum to explain the full prediction
        2. **Consistency**: If a feature helps more, its SHAP value increases
        3. **Missingness**: Features not used get zero SHAP value
        4. **Symmetry**: Features with equal contributions get equal credit
        """,
        
        "limitations": """
        While SHAP is powerful, it has limitations:
        
        - It explains WHAT the model thinks, not WHY the world is that way
        - High computation time for large datasets
        - Assumes feature independence (which may not be true)
        - Local explanation (specific to YOUR application, not general rules)
